This repository provides a replication package for [Reader (2023) The infant health effects of starting universal child benefits in pregnancy: evidence from England and Wales. Journal of Health Economics, 89, May 2023.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2023.102751)

I use two administrative datasets in the paper: 

1. \textbf{Birth registry microdata, 2006-2014}: this is individual-level administrative data from statutory birth registrations covering the universe of all registered births in England and Wales. The data are digitized and processed by the UK's National Statistical Agency, the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The data can only be accessed within the ONS's Secure Research Service environment. In order to access the data, researchers have to become [accredited](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/secureresearchservice/becomeanaccreditedresearcher) with the ONS and make a [project application](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/secureresearchservice/applyforanaccreditedresearchproject)
