I use two administrative datasets in the paper:

1. Birth registry microdata, 2006-2014: individual-level administrative data from statutory birth registrations in England and Wales. The data are digitized and processed by the UK's National Statistical Agency, the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The data are not publicly availabl but can be accessed within the ONS's Secure Research Service environment. Details on how to apply for the data can be found [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/secureresearchservice/applyforanaccreditedresearchproject).
2. Hospital Episode Statistics microdata, 2006-2014: individual-level administrative hospital records from England's National Health Service (NHS). The data are provided by NHS Digital and are not publicly available. Details on how to apply for the data can be found [here](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars).
3. Statistics on Women's Smoking Status at Time of Delivery, England, 2007-2015: published data from NHS Digital on the proportion of women known to be smoking at delivery. The raw annual datasets can be downloaded separately from the [NHS Digital website](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/statistics-on-women-s-smoking-status-at-time-of-delivery-england). A combined file is provided in the Data folder.
