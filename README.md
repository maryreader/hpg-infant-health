This repository provides a replication package for [Reader (2023) The infant health effects of starting universal child benefits in pregnancy: evidence from England and Wales. Journal of Health Economics, 89, May 2023.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2023.102751)

I use two administrative datasets in the paper:

1. Birth registry microdata, 2006-2014: individual-level administrative data from statutory birth registrations covering the universe of registered births in England and Wales. The data are digitized and processed by the UK's National Statistical Agency, the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The data are not publicly available. They can be accessed within the ONS's Secure Research Service environment. Details on how to apply for the data can be found [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/secureresearchservice/applyforanaccreditedresearchproject).
2. Hospital Episode Statistics microdata, 2006-2014: individual-level administrative hospital records from England's National Health Service (NHS). The data are not publicly available. Details on how to apply for the data can be found [here](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars).
